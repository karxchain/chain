# Karx Chain 🧬

**Karx Chain** is a modular, Ethereum-compatible blockchain infrastructure built to power **Digital Product Passports (DPP)** and verifiable product traceability. Developed by [Karpine Technologies](https://karpine.io), Karx Chain bridges enterprise supply chain systems with decentralized networks through transparency, interoperability, and open-source tooling.

---

## 🎯 Vision

To become the foundational infrastructure for enabling sustainable and ethical commerce through digital product passports, verifiable provenance, and traceable lifecycle events — at scale.

---

## 🧠 Why Karx is Different

🔹 **.NET-First Blockchain Stack** — We are proudly a .NET-first blockchain infrastructure. With more .NET developers in the world than Rust or Go, Karx unlocks adoption and contribution at scale by being deeply aligned with familiar tooling: ABP Framework, Blazor, and the broader C#/.NET ecosystem.

🔹 **Enterprise Integration Friendly** — Built to integrate with ERP, PLM, and supply chain tools like SAP, Oracle, and MS Dynamics.

🔹 **Modular by Design** — Each tool, smart contract, or node component can be extended, replaced, or used standalone.

## 🔧 Highlights

- **Ethereum-Compatible Chain** — Powered by custom Geth configurations
- **Digital Product Passport Ready** — Aligns with CIRPASS, EPCIS 2.0, and GS1 standards
- **Modular Architecture** — From smart contracts to admin tools and bridges
- **Enterprise & Developer Friendly** — Built on .NET, ABP Framework, and Blazor
- **Bridging Support** — XDC-compatible bridging layer
- **Native Token** — $KARX for gas, staking, and protocol utility
